# APMA3100-Probability
Coding Project for UVA's APMA3100 Probability course. These are small projects to demonstrate concepts in the study of probabilty. All code is written by me, however the intention of this repo is to house the code that will be included with the final written project.

## Project 1 
A exploration on counting methods and their related probabilities.

## Project 2
A Monte Carlo simulation with multiple outcomes per event. As well as an exponential distribution in one possible event. Explore the use of pseudorandomness to allow replication of experiments with seemingly random outcomes.
